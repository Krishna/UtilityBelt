# Utility Belt

A collection of useful source code for Apple platforms.

Utility Belt is about low ceremony, low maintenance code reuse.

Code currently is organised into folders for each language, with Swift folder for each language version.

There is no Xcode project associated with the source code. The intention behind this decision is to allow flexible and ceremony free code-reuse, and to ease maintainence efforts. (Eg no need to upgrade Xcode projects as Xcode versions change).
